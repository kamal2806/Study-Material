          children in India. Its primary work is to prepare and publish model
          textbooks, supplementary material, educational kits, etc. NCERT textbooks
          are the core of the schooling system. The CBSE board is following NCERT
          Books in the school curriculum for Class 1 to 12. Not only the CBSE but
